# TRAVELOWL
A website made with the sole purpose of giving a visual representation of a project whose goal is to show the touristic potential of certain cities and to promote small businesses nearby.
This website was made using only basic technologies such as pure HTML, CSS with a little bit of Bootstrap and some JavaScript.
Templates made for small businesses were done in Canva.
Certain improvements are planned to be done in the future.
